## Goal

Create a small web app which creates short links (like bit.ly)

## Story Requirements

There should be three “actions” a user can take:
*  Main page (/)  - contains a form where long URLs can be input and submitted. Form redirects to the info page on success. Must have validation. 
*  Short link info page (/view/abcd123) – shows information about the shortened URL.
*  Redirect link (/abcd123) – looks up the full URL and redirects to it.
